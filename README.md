# Jabber-Troubleshooting-Tool
This is a desktop application for troubleshooting Jabber issues. This tool runs multiple scans on the system and the VoIP infrastructure to check for any failures or possible issues. 

The user needs to either login with Unified Communications Manager credentials or IM&Presence credentials. Once the login is successful, the tool fetches details 
about the complete CUCM and IMP deployment.
